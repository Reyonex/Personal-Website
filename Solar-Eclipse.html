        <h1>My 2<sup>nd</sup> Solar Eclipse Experience<br><br></h1>
        <h3>To start off</h3>
        <p>I would consider it a coincidence that the day there is an eclipse, I also learned how to create my first few websites. They look bad but I am still trying to grow.</p>
        <h2>What happened:</h2>
		<p>It was amazing to see the solar eclipse of course but considering that this was my second eclipse, I was still got just as excited as I was 7 long years ago for it. I even went to a local ComicCon. I had so much fun in general.</p>
